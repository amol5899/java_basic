	/*
	 * The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that classes should be open for
	 * extension but closed for modification. “Open to extension” means that you
	 * should design your classes so that new functionality can be added as new
	 * requirements are generated. “Closed for modification” means that once you
	 * have developed a class you should never modify it, except to correct bugs.
	 * 
	 * Generally you achieve this by referring to abstractions for dependencies,
	 * such as interfaces or abstract classes, rather than using concrete classes.
	 * Functionality can be added by creating new classes that implement the
	 * interfaces.
	 * 
	 * Applying OCP to your projects limits the need to change source code once it
	 * has been written, tested, and debugged. This reduces the risk of introducing
	 * new bugs to existing code, leading to more robust software.
